# **Use Abella to prove equivalence of datalog rules**

In Polonius (the new Rust borrow checker)

By YIJUN Leng 

<!-- this is a "speaker note" -->

# WARMUP: Compile pass? Run pass?
```
#include<iostream>     
#include<vector>
using namespace std;

int main(){                          fn main() {            
  vector<int> v={12};                    let mut v=vec![12];
  auto x=&v[0];                          let x=&v[0];
  cout<<*x<<endl;                        dbg!(x);
                                     
  v.reserve(100);                        v.reserve(100);
  cout<<*x<<endl;                        dbg!(x);
}                                    }                       
```

---
# How Rust borrow checker(NLL) work
1. identify mutable/immutable borrow
2. each borrow's live span (in lines)
3. check conflict (mutable borrow and immutable borrow at same line)

```
1 fn main() {            
2     let mut v=vec![12];
3     let x=&v[0];
4     dbg!(x);
5 
6     v.reserve(100);
7     dbg!(x);
8 }                       
```

---
# Lightly desugared

```
1 fn main() {            
2     let mut v=vec![12];
3     let x=&v[0];
4     dbg!(x);
5 
6     Vec::reserve(&mut v, 100);
7     dbg!(x);
8 }                       
```

multiply immutable borrows / one mutable borrow 

mutable borrow: L6 
immutable borrow: L7 L6 L5 L4

            map.insert(22, String::from("hi"));
            &map[&22]

# How Polonius work?

```rust
cargo  rustc  -- -Zpolonius
// or
rustc -Zpolonius main.rs 
```

Polonius is based on datalog.

Compiler team created two set of rules: naive and datafrog-opt.

---
![bg](naive.png )
![bg](datafrog-opt.png )

---

![bg left:35% 80%](liveness.drawio.png )

In practise, naive = datafrog-opt.

In logic, naive = datafrog-opt (not intuitively)

But how do we formally prove it?
(This problem is first proposed by me, and first solved by me.)

# Choose a proof assistant to prove equivalence of datalog rules

- Isabella
- Z3
- Lean3 Lean4
- lambda prolog
    Teyjus
    ELPI(OCaml)
    **Abella(OCaml)**: suitable to express datalog

A lot of under developing...

--- 
# Steps
1. use Abella to describe datalog
1.1 input
1.2 naive and datafrog-opt
2. datafrog_opt_error => naive_error
3. naive_error => datafrog_opt_error

---
# 1. Use Abella to describe datalog
```
Kind origin type.
Kind loan type.
Kind point type.

Type origin_live_on_entry origin -> point -> prop.
Type loan_issued_at origin -> loan -> point -> prop.
Type cfg_edge point -> point -> prop.
Type loan_invalidated_at loan -> point -> prop.
Type not_loan_killed_at loan -> point -> prop.
Type subset_base origin -> origin -> point -> prop.
```

---

# 1. Use Abella to describe datalog
```
Define  naive_subset: origin -> origin -> point -> prop,
        naive_origin_contains_loan_on_entry: origin -> loan -> point -> prop,
        naive_loan_live_at: loan -> point -> prop,
        naive_errors: loan -> point -> prop  by

naive_subset Origin1  Origin2  Point  :=
  subset_base Origin1  Origin2  Point ;

naive_subset Origin1  Origin2  Point2  :=
  exists Point1,
  naive_subset Origin1  Origin2  Point1 /\
  cfg_edge Point1  Point2 /\
  origin_live_on_entry Origin1  Point2 /\
  origin_live_on_entry Origin2  Point2 ;
...
```

---
# 2. datafrog_opt_error => naive_error

```
Theorem DatafrogOpt2Naive:
  forall Loan,
  forall Point,
  datafrog_opt_errors Loan Point ->
  naive_errors Loan Point.
```

---
# Two important inspection

```
/* Lemma24 */
datafrog_opt_subset Origin1 Origin2 Point 
=> naive_subset Origin1 Origin2 Point

/* Lemma26 */
datafrog_origin_contain_loan_on_entry Origin Loan Point
=> naive_origin_contains_loan_on_entry Origin Loan Point
```

---
# Prove Lemma24

```
Theorem Lemma24:
  (
    forall Point,
    forall Origin1,
    forall Origin2,
    datafrog_opt_subset Origin1 Origin2 Point ->
    naive_subset Origin1 Origin2 Point
  ) /\ (
    forall Point1,
    forall Point2,
    forall Origin1,
    forall Origin2,
    dying_can_reach Origin1 Origin2 Point1 Point2  ->
    naive_subset Origin1 Origin2 Point1
  ).
```

---

# induction
```
Theorem even_odd : forall x , even x -> odd ( s x ) .
```

```
induction on 1.
```

Induction on one rule.

---

# Mutual induction: break cyclic proof

```
Define even : nat -> prop ,
       odd  : nat -> prop by
even z ;
even ( s N ) := odd N ;
odd ( s N ) := even N .

Theorem even_odd_nat :
  ( forall N , even N -> is_nat N ) /\ 
  ( forall N , odd N -> is_nat N ) .
```

```
induction on 1 1.
```


---
# 3. naive_error => datafrog_opt_error

Can we follow the trick before?
```
/* Lemma25 */
naive_subset Origin1 Origin9 Point
=> datafrog_opt_subset Origin1 Origin9 Point 

/* Lemma27 */
naive_origin_contains_loan_on_entry Origin Loan Point
=> datafrog_origin_contain_loan_on_entry Origin Loan Point
```

**WRONG!**

--- 
# Try applying small patches...

```
/* Lemma25 */
naive_subset Origin1 Origin9 Point
=> datafrog_opt_subset Origin2 Origin9 Point 

/* Lemma27 */
naive_origin_contains_loan_on_entry Origin9 Loan Point
=> datafrog_origin_contain_loan_on_entry Origin2 Loan Point
```

**STILL WRONG!**

Definitely, it's not trival to construct meaningful relationship from naive to datafrog-opt.

---

# How to deal with the gap?

What if `naive_subset` is defined as ...
Should not extensible along Point

```
Define  my_subset: origin -> origin -> point -> prop,
        my_origin_contains_loan_on_entry: origin -> loan -> point -> prop by
my_subset Origin1  Origin2  Point  := datafrog_opt_subset Origin1  Origin2  Point ;
my_subset Origin1  Origin3  Point  :=
  exists Origin2,
  datafrog_opt_subset Origin1  Origin2  Point /\
  my_subset Origin2  Origin3  Point ;
my_origin_contains_loan_on_entry Origin Loan Point  := datafrog_opt_origin_contains_loan_on_entry Origin Loan Point ;
my_origin_contains_loan_on_entry Origin2  Loan  Point  :=
  exists Origin1,
  my_origin_contains_loan_on_entry Origin1  Loan  Point /\
  datafrog_opt_subset Origin1  Origin2  Point .
```

---

# Redefine naive_* with datafrog_opt_*

my_origin_contain_loan_on_entry <=> naive_origin_contains_loan_on_entry 

my_subset <=> naive_subset

---

```
my_subset Origin1  Origin2  Point  := datafrog_opt_subset Origin1  Origin2  Point ;
my_subset Origin1  Origin3  Point  :=
  exists Origin2,
  datafrog_opt_subset Origin1  Origin2  Point /\
  my_subset Origin2  Origin3  Point ;
```

are similar to the classical recursive type definition:

```
Kind nat type.
Type zero  nat.
Type s nat -> nat.
```

```
Kind list type .
Type empty list.
Type cons nat -> list -> list.
```

---
# Conclusion

We prove two algorithms in Polonius produce the same result, based on only one axiom.

## Main tactic

(mutual) induction

--- 
# Benefit from this proof

We don't need to test the correctness of datafrog-opt any more.
We only need to test the implementation correctness.

Helpful to verify new datalog rules before implementation.

# Future work
Another approach to prove?

# Personal future work 
1. Work on mlsub
2. Make Polonius the default borrow checker of Rust

# Why we need proof assistant?
- Succinctness
- Repeatability
- Discover problem in proof

Theorem OriginLiveAxiom:                                                                                                    
  forall Origin,

  (origin_live_on_entry Origin Point ) \/ ( origin_live_on_entry Origin Point -> false).                           
skip.
```
A function is the negative of fact!

```
H1: origin_live_on_entry Origin Point 
H2: origin_live_on_entry Origin Point -> false
```
We can use `search` tactic to get false quickly.
TODO: How to express three mutually exclusive states?

# Tricky things in Abella

Both true and false!
Abella will give a warning.

```
Define p : prop by
p := p -> false .

Theorem p_true : p .
unfold . intros . case H1 ( keep ) . apply H2 to H1 .

Theorem notp_true : p -> false .
intros . case H1 ( keep ) . apply H2 to H1 .
```

# Axiom in Abella
```
/* The only axiom introduced */
Theorem OriginLiveAxiom:                                                                                                    
  forall Origin,                                                                                                   
  forall Point,                                                                                                    
  (origin_live_on_entry Origin Point ) \/ ( origin_live_on_entry Origin Point -> false).                           
skip.
```
`skip` is the only way to express axiom.

# Abella is powerful
Abella is suitable to express datalog.

But we only utilize a little functionality in Abella here.

Coinduction, nable, lambda calculas, pi calculas ...

# But Abella can't prove any truth!
