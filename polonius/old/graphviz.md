I have a suggestion on visualization of polonius.

The graphviz file generated by `--graphviz-file` doesn't contain mir statements.
It's inconvenient for debuging.
I suggest to put mir statements inside the dot file.

# Possible approach
Add a `dump-polonius` parameter to rustc.
Rustc generate the graphviz file based on intemediate mir and polonius output.


------------------
# My concern:
This requires a lot of modification to both polonius and rustc.
I wonder if it's acceptable.

If you think this improvement is feasible, I will try it.

本来有这个想法，不过现在变化太大，不用datalog了，改用chalk,所以就不用再看了
